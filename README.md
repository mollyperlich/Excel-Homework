Excel Homework 1, due 1/23/19
What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?
-	Majority (53%) of kick-starters were successful 
-	Least successful sub-category (with 100 cancellations and 60 failures) is 'web' 
-	Kick-starters seem to be the most successful in May, June and February (in descending order). This could be due to pre-holiday or holiday month surges (Veterans Day, pre- 4th of July, Valentines Day). 
What are some of the limitations of this dataset?
-	Averages are not weighted, may have helped to have a min/max from the donations 
-	"Staff_Pick" and "spotlight" are not defined 
-	Also does not show rate at which campaign gained money
-	Currency should be standardized 
What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?
-	One that filters category/subcategory on the row labels
o	Example:
"	Category
"	> Subcategories 
-	Graph category v. percentage of completion 
-	Graph country v. percentage of completion
